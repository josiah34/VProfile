# VProfile

In this project I will be documenting the process of deploying a multi tier wb application stack. This will be setup locally.



**Tools**:
-  Virtualbox (Hypervisor)
- Automation (Vagrant)


**Services**: 
- NGINX
- TOMCAT 
- RABBITMQ
- MEMCACHED
- MYSQL


1. I will be cloning the Project repo for the web application that I'll be deploying. ``https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project/tree/local-setup``
2. Next I will be using a vagrant file to deploy 5 different vms to run all the project services.
